\title{Simulate a dataset for demonstrating the performance of screenIID with the DC-SIS method}
\usage{
simulateDCSIS(n = 200, p = 5000, rho = 0, heteroskedastic = TRUE,
  sigma = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of subjects in the dataset to be simulated.  It will also equal to the number of rows
in the  dataset to be simulated, because it is assumed that each row represents a different independent and
identically distributed subject.}

\item{p}{Number of predictor variables (covariates) in the simulated dataset.  These covariates
will be the features screened by DC-SIS.}

\item{rho}{The correlation between adjacent covariates in the simulated matrix X.  The within-subject covariance
matrix of X is assumed to has the same form as an AR(1) autoregressive covariance matrix,
although this is not meant to imply that the X covariates for each subject are in fact a time
series.  Instead, it is just used as an example of a parsimonious but nontrivial covariance
structure.  If rho is left at the default of zero, the X covariates will be independent
and the simulation will run faster.}

\item{heteroskedastic}{Whether the error variance should be allowed to depend on one of the predictor variables.}

\item{sigma}{The error standard deviation of the response}
}
\value{
A list with following components:
     \item{X:}{Matrix of predictors to be screened. It will have n rows and p columns.}
     \item{Y:}{Vector of responses.It will have length n.}
}
\description{
Simulates a dataset that can be used to demonstrate variable screening
for ultrahigh-dimensional regression with the DC-SIS option in screenIID.
The simulated dataset has p numerical predictors X and a categorical Y-response.
The data-generating scenario is a simplified version of Example 3.1a (homoskedastic) or 3.1d
(heteroskedastic) of  Li, Zhong & Zhu (2012).
Specifically, the X covariates are normally distributed with mean zero and variance one, and
may be correlated if the argument rho is set to a nonzero value.  The response Y is generated as
either
       Y = 6*X1 + 1.5*X2  + 9*1{X12 < 0} + exp(2*X22)*e
if heteroskedastic=TRUE, or
       Y = 6*X1 + 1.5*X2  + 9*1{X12 < 0} + 6*X22 + e
if heteroskedastic=FALSE, where e is a standard normal error term and 1{} is a zero-one
indicator function for the truth of the statement contained.
 Special thanks are due to Wei Zhong for providing some of the code upon which this function is based.
