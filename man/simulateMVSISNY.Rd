\title{Simulate a dataset for demonstrating the performance of screenIID with the MV-SIS method with numeric outcome Y}
\usage{
simulateMVSISNY(n = 500, p = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of subjects in the dataset to be simulated.  It will also equal to the number of rows
in the  dataset to be simulated, because it is assumed that each row represents a different independent and
identically distributed subject.}

\item{p}{Number of predictor variables (covariates) in the simulated dataset.  These covariates
will be the features screened by DC-SIS.}
}
\value{
A list with following components:
     X Matrix of predictors to be screened. It will have n rows and p columns.
     Y Vector of responses.  It will have length n.
}
\description{
Simulates a dataset that can be used to demonstrate variable screening
for ultrahigh-dimensional regression with categorical predictors and numerical outcome
variable using the MV-SIS-NY option in screenIID.
The simulated dataset has p numerical predictors X and a categorical response Y.
The X covariates are generated as binary with success probability 0.5 each.  The
response Y is generated as
       Y = 5*X1 + 5*X2  + 5*X12 + 5*X22 + e
if heteroskedastic=FALSE, where e is a standard normal error term and 1{} is a zero-one
indicator function for the truth of the statement contained.
 Special thanks are due to Wei Zhong for providing some of the code upon which this function is based.
