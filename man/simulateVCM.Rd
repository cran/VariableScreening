\title{Simulate a dataset for testing the performance of screenVCM}
\usage{
simulateVCM(
  n = 200,
  rho = 0.4,
  p = 1000,
  trueIdx = c(2, 100, 400, 600, 1000),
  betaFun = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of subjects in the simulated dataset}

\item{rho}{The correlation matrix of columns of X.}

\item{p}{The total number of features to be screened from}

\item{trueIdx}{The indexes for the active features in the simulated X matrix.
This should be a vector, and the values should be a subset of 1:p.}

\item{betaFun}{A list of functions of U, one function for each entry in trueIdx,
giving the varying effects of each active predictor in the simulated
X matrix.}
}
\value{
A list with following components:
     X Matrix of predictors to be screened. It will have n rows and p columns.
     Y Vector of responses.  It will have length of n.
     U A vector representing a covariate with which the coefficient functions vary.
}
\description{
Simulates a dataset that can be used to test the screenVCM
function, and to test the performance of the proposed method under different
scenarios. The simulated dataset has a single U-covariate and p X-predictors,
only a few of which have nonzero effect.

  Jingyuan Liu for providing some of the code upon which this function is based.
